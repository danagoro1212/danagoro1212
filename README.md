## üîç LinkedIn Job Automation Script

**Description:**  
A Python-based automation script that identifies relevant job postings on LinkedIn, filters them based on predefined criteria (language, role type, part-time), and logs them into a structured Google Sheet for ongoing tracking.

**What I Did:**  
- Used Selenium to automate browser interaction on a persistent Chrome profile
- Parsed job data with custom filters for student-friendly part-time tech roles
- Integrated Google Sheets API for logging, deduplication, and cleanup of old jobs
- Designed with scalability in mind for potential future deployment to cloud (e.g., GCP)

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `Selenium`, `Google Sheets API`, `ChromeDriver`

**Repository:**

## üåê Facebook Post Comparison Chrome Extension

**Description:**  
A Chrome extension I built to easily compare Facebook posts‚Äîlike listings for apartments or service providers. Users can save posts, extract relevant details, and view everything in a clean comparison table.

**What I Did:**  
- Injected an ‚ÄúAdd to Compare‚Äù button into Facebook posts, including detecting the author and adding a direct Messenger link when available  
- Used Regex to extract post content (location, price, phone number) and stored it in localStorage  
- Built a responsive comparison table with sorting, searching, personal notes, and export to Excel  
- Enabled easy contact via WhatsApp or Messenger with automatic message templates (e.g., ‚ÄúHi, I saw your post on Facebook, is this still relevant?‚Äù)  
- Future plan: add ML-based auto-tagging for post types (e.g., apartment, roommate, service)

**Tech Stack:**  
`JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Chrome Extensions API`, `Regex`, `localStorage`

**Repository:**
